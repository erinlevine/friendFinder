Goal of this assignment is to create an app to find your Slothmate! 

- User inputs their name and a photo of themselves (both optional because I don't want people to get weirded out by adding their photo). 

- User is then asked a series of questions on a survey. 

- Once survey is completed, user is then matched with a cute, snuggly, algae-ridden sloth! 

For this assignment, I used: 

- Express
- bodyParser
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
- jQuery
- JavaScript
